# Dynamic-Quote-For-you-Mini-project
# Descriptions
This is a Dynamic Quote For you (mini-project) website that displays dynamic quotes for users. The project is built with Next.js (React framework) and uses Supabase as the backend database. Quotes are stored in Supabase and fetched through its API, then displayed dynamically on the frontend.
# Project Setup
1. Install Dependencies: Open terminal and install the require packages(npm install)
2. Configure Environment Variables: Create a files name(.env.local) and I add your Supabase API URL and anonymous key to this file
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
3. Run the Development Server(npm run dev) and then open http://localhost:3000 in browser to see the app.
# Project Architecture
1.Frontend (Next.js):Handles the user interface and displays dynamic quotes. It communicates with the backend through Supabaseâ€™s API.
2.Backend (Supabase):Acts as the database layer where all the quotes are stored. Supabase provides an API to read/write data securely.
3.Communication Flow: 
3.1 User opens the website in the browser. 
3.2 Next.js (frontend) sends a request to Supabase via the provided API keys. 
3.3 Supabase returns the stored quotes. -Next.js renders and displays the quote dynamically on the page.
